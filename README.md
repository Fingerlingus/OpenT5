# OpenT5

## A portable, cross-platform reimplementation of T5 (Treyarch's internal codename for the engine running Call of Duty Black Ops).

Please note this project is in its *very* early stages. If it ever becomes feature-complete, that day is a long ways off. Unless you're interested in contributing, you're not going to find anything useful here anytime soon. That said, if you *are* interested in contributing, *any* help is more than welcome, as this is currently a one-woman project. C++20 is planned to be used later, but seeing as most of the lower-level parts of the engine are basically Quake 3 code (some of them, like Q_rsqrt() are entirely untouched save for a change in naming convention), the project is mostly C11 right now.
