# OpenT5

## A portable, cross-platform reimplementation of T5 (Treyarch's internal codename for the engine running Call of Duty Black Ops).

Please note, if you've somehow manager to stumble across here, this project is in its *very* early stages. If it ever becomes feature-complete, that day is a long ways off. Unless you're interested in contributing, you're not going to find anything useful here anytime soon. That said, if you *are* interested in contributing, *any* help is more than welcome, as this is currently a one-woman project. C++20 is planned to be used later, but seeing as most of the lower-level parts of the engine are basically Quake 3 code (some of them, like Q_rsqrt() are entirely untouched save for a change in naming convention), the project is mostly C11 right now.
